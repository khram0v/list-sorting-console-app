# List Sorting Application
This is a simple project implementing sorting algorithms and array manipulation functionalities. 
It allows users to perform basic actions with array and sort the array in both ascending and descending order.
The focus is on practical implementation and performance considerations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine (for contributors recommended to fork first)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khram0v/different-sorting-algorithms.git
2. Use any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse etc.) to view files.
3. In Shell or terminal make sure you are in src directory and run command: javac Main.java
4. After completion your folder will contain 3 .class files
5. In terminal run command: java Main

## Visual
After running java Main you should see this interface
